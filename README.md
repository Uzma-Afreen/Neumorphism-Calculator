# Neumorphism Calculator

This project is a web-based calculator application featuring a **neumorphic design** aesthetic, with soft shadows and rounded edges for a clean, modern look. The calculator provides essential arithmetic and scientific functions, combining functionality with an elegant, minimalistic user interface.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Operations**:
  - Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
  - Logarithmic function: `log`
  - Constants: `π`, `e`
  - Factorial calculation: `X!`
  - Power and root functions: `x^y`, `√`
- **Neumorphic Design**: Soft, rounded UI elements with shadow effects.
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on various screen sizes and devices.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure and elements for the calculator interface.
- **style.css**: Provides the neumorphic styling and layout for buttons, display, and overall aesthetics.
- **script.js**: Implements the calculator's logic and interactive functionality.
